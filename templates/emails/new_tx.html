A new transaction of <b>{{ sent_in_btc }}</b> {{ currency_abbrev }} (including change) was just detected on the blockchain.
You can see the transaction details here:<br />
<a href="{{ BASE_URL }}{% url 'transaction_overview' coin_symbol tx_hash %}">{{ BASE_URL }}{% url 'transaction_overview' coin_symbol tx_hash %}</a>

{% if destination_address %}
  <br /><br />
  {% if satoshis_transacted > 10000 %}
    Since you previously setup forwarding on this address, the funds should automatically be transferred to
    <a href="{{ BASE_URL }}{% url 'address_overview' coin_symbol destination_address %}">{{ destination_address }}</a>
    immediately.
  {% else %}
    Even though you previously setup forwarding on this address, the amount sent is lower than the mining fee so these funds may not be transferred to
    <a href="{{ BASE_URL }}{% url 'address_overview' coin_symbol destination_address %}">{{ destination_address }}</a>.
  {% endif %}
{% endif %}

<br /><br />
Note that this transaction has {{ num_confs }} confirmations on the {{ currency_display_name }} blockchain, meaning that the transaction could theoretically still be reversed.
